This is a telegram chatbot using the Koboldccp API. (You can find my bot [@ropori_tanuki_bot](https://t.me/ropori_tanuki_bot) however I only run it locally, from time to time.)

<b>Taunki is a ridiculous racoon dog who imbibes in sake, performs magic and loves a joke. This bot is great for entertaining Japanese or English language practice!</b>

First install [Koboldccp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/). Load the tanuki character card (JSON file) into Kobold app with the GGML or GGUF model of your model of choice. Run the tanuki_telegram_bot locally and serve Kobold API output to your telegram bot account.

A .env file should contain the telegram API-KEY for your bot.
